Give it a try <br>

The Delhi Property Price Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the price of properties in Delhi, India. This project uses a dataset of property prices in Delhi and various features related to the properties, such as the number of rooms, location, and area. The machine learning model is trained on this dataset and is capable of predicting the price of a property based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Magic Bricks. It contains information about property prices in New Delhi. Following are the features used for model

<b>Area</b><br>
<b>BHK</b><br>
<b>Bathroom</b><br>
<b>Furnishing</b><br>
<b>Parking</b><br>
<b>Transaction</b><br>
<b>Type</b><br>

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:<br>

Python 3<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Pandas<br>
Scikit-Learn<br>
NumPy<br>
You can install the required packages using pip or Anaconda.
 
## Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. This technique is applicable for Supervised Learning Regression problems where we try to predict a continuous variable.
Linear Regression can be further classified into two types â€“ Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In this project, I employ Simple Linear Regression technique where I have one independent and one dependent variable. It is the simplest form of Linear Regression where we fit a straight line to the data.<br>
